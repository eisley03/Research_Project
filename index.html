    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1> 
    <h3>The Creation</h3>
    <p>
        AI or artificial intelligence was a concept that was foreign to the minds of most, but this changed starting in the 1950's. 
        The first to suggest the possibility of AI was Alan Turing. He found the mathematical possibility behind the compostiion of artificial intelligence. 
        Turing published his first paper in which he dicusses the question, "If humans can problem solve, why can't machines?"
        During this time, however, computers were not what we view them as today. 
        It would be years later before the theory of AI could be developed and tested for use.
