    <h3>The Creation</h3>
    <p>
        AI or artificial intelligence was a concept that was foreign to the minds of most, but this changed starting in the 1950s. 
        The first to suggest the possibility of AI was Alan Turing. He found the mathematical possibility behind the composition of artificial intelligence. 
        Turing published his first paper in which he discusses the question, "If humans can problem solve, why can't machines?"
        During this time, however, computers were not what we view them as today. 
        It would be years later before the theory of AI could be developed and tested for use. 
        The first <i>milestone</i> of AI development happened in the late 1950s when the first program was designed to mimic human problem-solving skills. 
        This program allowed a computer to independently learn how to play chess against a human opponent. 
        John McCarthy was a well-known programmer associated with artificial intelligence. 
        He created a programming language called LISP that is known for being one of the longest-lived computer languages. 
        LISP became the most used computer language for the beginning of programming AI. 
        This was due to its ability to be written as a “self-modifying” program. 
        During the 1960s the artificial intelligence field grew with the creation of new programming languages that showed the importance of AI development. 
        The first automated robot came into use during the 1960s in factories. 
        The jobs were deemed unsuitable for human employees so companies opted for an industrial robot to handle the dangerous tasks. 
        These were the first instances in which AI was used to benefit the human population.

    <h3>WABOT-1 & WABOT-2</h3>
    <p>
        In the 1970s, the world of artificial intelligence continued to flourish. 
        The programming languages advanced and the availability of computers increased leaving a perfect storm for technology advances. 
        In 1970, the WABOT-1 was beginning to be developed at the Waseda University in Japan. 
        The WABOT-1 was one of the first successful cases of artificial intelligence with human capabilities. 
        The robot was able to extend its limbs and grip objects with the capability to move them. 
        They also gave the robot the ability to have semi-functioning sensory abilities. 
        The one downfall of this device was the speed in which it was able to carry out its functions. 
        One WABOT-1 step would take at least 45 seconds to complete which made this robot non-functional in assisting humans.

        The WABOT-2 was created six years later. 
        This robot had the capability of reading sheet music, talking to a human, and even singing alongside a human.
