    <h3>The Creation</h3>
    <p>
        AI or artificial intelligence was a concept that was foreign to the minds of most, but this changed starting in the 1950s. 
        The first to suggest the possibility of AI was Alan Turing. He found the mathematical possibility behind the composition of artificial intelligence. 
        Turing published his first paper in which he discusses the question, "If humans can problem solve, why can't machines?"
        During this time, however, computers were not what we view them as today. 
        It would be years later before the theory of AI could be developed and tested for use. 
        The first <i>milestone</i> of AI development happened in the late 1950s when the first program was designed to mimic human problem-solving skills. 
        This program allowed a computer to independently learn how to play chess against a human opponent. 
        John McCarthy was a well-known programmer associated with artificial intelligence. 
        He created a programming language called LISP that is known for being one of the longest-lived computer languages. 
        LISP became the most used computer language for the beginning of programming AI. 
        This was due to its ability to be written as a “self-modifying” program. 
        During the 1960s the artificial intelligence field grew with the creation of new programming languages that showed the importance of AI development. 
        The first automated robot came into use during the 1960s in factories. 
        The jobs were deemed unsuitable for human employees so companies opted for an industrial robot to handle the dangerous tasks. 
        These were the first instances in which AI was used to benefit the human population.

    <h3>WABOT-1 & WABOT-2</h3>
    <p>
        In the 1970s, the world of artificial intelligence continued to flourish. 
        The programming languages advanced and the availability of computers increased leaving a perfect storm for technology advances. 
        In 1970, the WABOT-1 was beginning to be developed at the Waseda University in Japan. 
        The WABOT-1 was one of the first successful cases of artificial intelligence with human capabilities. 
        The robot was able to extend its limbs and grip objects with the capability to move them. 
        They also gave the robot the ability to have semi-functioning sensory abilities. 
        The one downfall of this device was the speed at which it was able to carry out its functions. 
        One WABOT-1 step would take at least 45 seconds to complete which made this robot non-functional in assisting humans. 
        This milestone paved the way to create a helpful “personal” robot for the masses.

            The WABOT-2 was created six years later. 
            This robot had the capability of reading sheet music, talking to a human, and even singing alongside a human. 
            These two humanoids were the start of modern artificial intelligence. 
            During this time period the classic film Star Wars by George Lucas. 
            The creation of Star Wars highlighted the possibility of robots with human functions and human thoughts. 
            The film featured two humanoid robots that made the modern world of artificial intelligence a reality to the masses. 
            Once the reality of robots was introduced to the public the film industry took the concept and ran with it. 
            There were many films that came after the original Star Wars that featured intelligent robotics.

        <h3>Kismet the Robot</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout the 1990s there were many new types of programming languages created that made advances in computer technology easier. 
            This trend continued into the 2000s as many researchers decided to focus on AI technology. 
            At MIT, there was a new technology brewing. 
            Kismet, an artificially intelligent robot, was under development by MIT’s Professor Cynthia Breazeal. 
            Kismet is the first robot that could use expressive modes of communication. 
            This robot proved that humanoids could interact and socialize alongside humans.
            The significance of this interaction showed that robots of all kinds could play a part in our daily lives. 
            Kismet had software and modifications that allowed it to perceptualize human interactions. 
            It could hear and respond to human speech, see and respond to human facial expressions, and watch and follow human movements. 
            It has swivel capabilities in its neck that allow movement in a certain degree of motion. 
            The Kismet can react to human speech through its auditory device which is picked up through a microphone given to the “caregiver”. 
            The Kismet had many cameras that allowed it to react and respond to many types of human interactions. 
            When there is not a human or toy interacting with the Kismet it is able to show sadness and present that it wants to play. 
            The concept of Kismet was applied to furbies. 
            Furbies were a popular early 2000s toy with almost the same capabilities as Kismet. 
            Kismet was more advanced, but furbies were sold to the mass market towards children. 
            These toys become popular for their need-based play. 
            Children loved nurturing these creepy toys and these became one of the first instances of AI introduced on a worldwide scale.
