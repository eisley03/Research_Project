    <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1> 
    <h3>The Creation</h3>
    <p>
        AI or artificial intelligence was a concept that was foreign to the minds of most, but this changed starting in the 1950s. 
        The first to suggest the possibility of AI was Alan Turing. He found the mathematical possibility behind the composition of artificial intelligence. 
        Turing published his first paper in which he discusses the question, "If humans can problem solve, why can't machines?"
        During this time, however, computers were not what we view them as today. 
        It would be years later before the theory of AI could be developed and tested for use. 
        The first milestone of AI development happened in the late 1950s when the first program was designed to mimic human problem-solving skills. 
        This program allowed a computer to independently learn how to play chess against a human opponent.
